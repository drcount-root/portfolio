## About

Hi, here's a little about me. ðŸ˜Š

<hr>
I am a full-stack developer, currently building/breaking/fixing stuff at <b>Crio.do</b>. I have worked with a lot of technologies and am quite fast in learning new things as well. Currently, I am figuring out backend architecture, design, infra scaling and cloud. I have also tinkered with ML/AI (can get a lot of things working) but am not actively improving myself in those.

I always find myself in situations where I know the most complicated stuff but end up Googling the simplest things (like how to read csv hehe). I can learn new stuff fairly quickly and build amazing things with it! You can find most of my builds on <a href="https://github.com/drcount-root" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

Apart from development, I have a passion for teaching mathematics which I try to do as much as possible whenever I get a chance. I love to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile" target="_blank">Numberphile</a> & <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Computerphile" target="_blank">Computerphile</a>

I like to play chess & carrom. Pandemic got me interested in plants and I have been studying more about botany since!
