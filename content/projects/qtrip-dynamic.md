## Description

**QTrip - Dynamic** is a travel website aimed at travellers looking for a multitude of adventures in different cities.

During the course of this micro-experience, I have created:

<ul>

<li>
Created web pages using <b>HTML 5</b> and <b>CSS</b> and made them dynamic using <b>JavaScript</b>.
</li>

<li>
Improved <b>UX</b> with multi-select filters, image carousels.
</li>

<li>
Implemented <b>conditional rendering</b> of page elements. Fetch data using <b>REST APIs</b> and dynamically render landing page.
</li>

<li>
Utilized <b>localStorage</b> to persist user preferences at <b>client-side</b>.
</li>

<li>
Used <b>JQuery</b> to facilitate the reservation form submission.
</li>

<li>
Deployed the website using <b>Netlify</b> and <b>Heroku</b>.
</li>
</ul>
