## Description

**XBoard** is a News Feed website that will feature the latest news for select topics, from Flipboard.

During the course of this micro-experience, I have created:

<ul>
<li>
Built <b>XBoard</b> using <b>HTML 5</b>, <b>CSS 3</b>, <b>Bootstrap 5</b>, <b>JavaScript</b> and <b>JQuery</b> from scratch.
</li>

<li>
Utilized the <b>figma</b> file to understand the design requirements.
</li>

<li>
Used Accordions and Image Carousel to improve <b>UI</b>.
</li>

<li>
Fetched news content from <b>flipboard</b>'s RSS feed using <b>REST APIs</b>.
</li>

<li>
Deployed the website to <b>Netlify</b>.
</li>
</ul>
